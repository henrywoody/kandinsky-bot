— Wassily Kandinsky

This program creates random works of "art" in the style of Wassily Kandinsky. Mostly inspired by *Composition VIII*, though *Color Study. Squares with Concentric Circles* was an influence as well.

Kandinsky, W. (1923). *Composition VIII* [Painting].

While most of the images produced by KandinskyBot are trash, there is the odd gem—around 1-2%. The infrequency of quality images is part of the fun.

Here are a few samples:

![Composition 1141](https://github.com/henrywoody/kandinsky-bot/tree/master/samples/1141.eps)

KandinskyBot (2017). *Composition 1141* [Digital].

Also I have an Instagram account (which I have been neglecting) that shows images generated by this bot. Check it out: https://www.instagram.com/kandinskybot/



The graphics library (`graphics.py`) was written by John Zelle for Chapter 4 of "Python
Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science".



## Running The Program

To generate single paintings at a time, run `src/run.py`.

To generate batches of paintings, run `src/batch_run.py`.
