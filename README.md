# Kandinsky Bot

> Everything starts from a dot.

— Wassily Kandinsky

This program creates random works of "art" in the style of Wassily Kandinsky. Mostly inspired by *Composition VIII*, though *Color Study. Squares with Concentric Circles* was an influence as well.

While most of the images produced by KandinskyBot are trash, there is the odd gem—around 1-2%. The infrequency of quality images is part of the fun.

Here are a few samples:

Also I have an Instagram account (which I have been neglecting) that shows images generated by this bot. Check it out: https://www.instagram.com/kandinskybot/



The graphics library (`graphics.py`) was written by John Zelle for Chapter 4 of "Python
Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science".



## Running The Program

To generate single paintings at a time, run `src/run.py`.

To generate batches of paintings, run `src/batch_run.py`.

### Output

Output images are in `.eps` format. To convert to a raster format I'd recommend using ImageMagick, which you can get with:

```shell
brew install imagemagick
```

if you have Homebrew installed. Otherwise visit [their site](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php).

Then you can convert an image (`image.eps`) to some other format (`image.png`) with:

```shell
convert -density 300 image.eps image.png
```

To convert many `.eps` files, this is a handy script (run from the directory containing the `.eps` files):

```shell
for img in *.eps
do
	convert -density 300 $img ${img%.*}.png
done
```

*Note*: It will take a while.
